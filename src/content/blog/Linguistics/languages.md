During my childhood, I studied Chinese, French, Latin and VCE English Language formally, and from there, I began a passion for learning languages and the potential that it yields.

Some languages I will cover are English (of course), Chinese, French, Latin, Ancient Greek and German.

I will also look at my project [@medetymology](https://www.instagram.com/medetymology), language pedagogy, the history of English, the evolution of scripts and how all of these interlink.
