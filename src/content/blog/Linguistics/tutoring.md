**About Me**  
My name is Josh, and I graduated high school in Melbourne in 2020, and have been tutoring since then. I'm always open to chat about your tutoring enquiries! I am happy to do either in-person or Zoom tutoring, and can do both individual and group classes.

Simply use the form on the main page or email me at joshpoonblog@gmail.com to get in contact about tutoring.

I have two public advertisements online for my tutoring services: [Highschooltutors.com.au](https://highschooltutors.com.au/listings/30749) and [Facebook VCEDS Post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/VCEDS/posts/3802280196503598).

**VCE Latin Course**  
The VCE Latin Course requires two main skills - that of translation and that of text analysis. In VCE 3/4, all students will do their text analysis (comprehension, grammar, and essay) on one of the 12 books in Virgil's _Aeneid_.

Translation requires you to be fluent in Latin - that is, you know the entire grammar (mostly classical Latin grammar), a range of vocabulary and are able to problem solve to solve the 'puzzle' that is translation. Latin sentences often do not have a predefined word order - although patterns do exist - so it is up to the student to think on the spot.

The text analysis section in VCE Latin is on Virgil's Aeneid - an epic poem written between 30 BC and 20 BC which details a crucial part of the history of the Romans. The Romans believed that they came from the Trojans - who, in myth, are homeless after the being defeated in the Trojan War. They have to find a new homeland for their people, and Aeneas, the hero of the epic, is their leader. The _Aeneid_ details their years wandering the seas, settling in North Africa, journeying to the Underworld, before finally fighting a war against the Italians. Themes including the gods, mission, fate and the humanity of Aeneas intricately flow throughout the text, and need to be discussed in any good essay. 

People often think that Latin is a dead language - but it's not because it lives on through the modern languages it has evolved into and influenced, as well in religious culture and in scientific language! I aim to make classes as enjoyable, yet informative as possible, tailored specific to the student's needs.

**2023 Latin Tutoring credentials**

I now mainly exclusively tutor Latin (while balancing two part time jobs in retail and healthcare, music, sport, church, social and academic commitments).
- I am very well acquainted with the Latin language; I also have a strong understanding of linguistics and history of languages.
- I have a broad experience in teaching Latin, teaching it from a beginner level, such as helping students to pick up the language, to VCE Unit 3/4 Level.
- I am well acquainted with all books of the Aeneid, which is the text studied in VCE Unit 4, and am highly proficient in all aspects of the language required for Latin unseens. 
- I have a range of resources such as notes, practice questions and sample unseens.
- I have a depth of knowledge of the structure of both the Oxford and Cambridge Latin courses, having taught from both extensively
- I love what Latin has taught me, and did it because I'm passionate about language learning, not for the scaling! I studied French in high school and am currently learning German.
- I love history and seeing the connections between language and culture in a classical context.

**Testimonials from 2023**

I really enjoyed studying with Josh for VCE Latin. Not only did I improve my translating and text analysis, I also learnt to appreciate the Aeneid more, particularly its themes and literary merits. Josh was instrumental in guiding me through the VCE Latin course, and whenever I had any questions he would be able to help, or was willing to investigate more for me. His enthusiasm and passion for the subject shone through, which helped me in my studies and my own enjoyment as well. His tutoring approach is very supportive and non-judgemental, and I felt free to make mistakes and improve constantly. While Latin is a difficult subject, he led me through it very well, culminating in a successful VCE result. Big thanks to Josh!

I had Josh Poon for both Latin and Physics tutoring, and he was a great tutor for both subjects. He was very encouraging, even if you were to get something incorrect, and he made sure to include all students in the discussion during the group tutoring. Josh had a deep understanding in the subjects, and even though he does not specialise in physics, he still explained the concepts really well and clearly, and in way that is easy to understand. Having tutoring with Josh made me feel more confident for my year 12 exams, and I strongly recommend him for future VCE students.

**Testimonials from 2022**

Throughout my year 12 studies in 2022 I had undertaken Latin as one of my subjects. Due to the challenging nature of the subject, I sought out Joshua to give me some guidance in private tutoring lessons. Joshua was a very knowledgeable tutor whose enthusiasm and love for Latin even past his graduation really rubbed off on me. His approach to tutoring emphasised working on my weaknesses in the subjects and him modifying my approach to sections like the unseen translation scrupulously. He was always patient and encouraging, with not only Latin but the whole of year 12 and as a medical aspirant myself, he also took time to give me insight into managing the year 12 workload and working towards my goals. This all-rounded approach that Joshua gave to his tutoring inspired many of my study techniques and attitudes towards academics to this day, and I leave him my highest recommendation.

**Testimonials from 2021**

Josh is an excellent tutor who has extensive knowledge, understanding and interest in Maths Methods and English Language and he supported me greatly throughout VCE especially during remote learning. He helped me significantly to improve and gain confidence within my subjects in year 12 as he was easily able to adapt lessons to cater to my specific concerns and focus on my weaknesses by helping me understand and rectify my mistakes. Josh provided me with many resources throughout the year such as notes, practise sacs and exam revision materials. Josh is also very kind and I felt comfortable asking questions as he was always happy to re-explain any concepts that I found difficult. He was flexible with class times and I was able to contact and receive help and detailed feedback from him outside of class times. Thanks to Josh I was able to really enjoy my subjects this year and was also able to achieve rank 1 at my school for English language this year which would not have been possible without his teaching and advice.

I started with Joshua during the summer school holidays and we had begun from the start. Everything we covered even from the start to the end had a significant impact on my understanding and knowledge of methods. We were able to meet quite frequently when possible and I began to become more confident as time went on. I really couldn’t recommend Joshua enough! His accolades prove so and is a super nice person very approachable and useful to ask for any questions regarding how to improve as a student and with any questions you may get stuck with! Also provided me with useful notes and cas tricks school hadn’t shown me!
