It's been 2.5 years into the pandemic. One eighth of my life has been spent worrying about this virus which first made its appearance in Wuhan back in January 2020 and has caused fear, tears, lockdowns. Politics and public health policies have been forever changed by the pandemic. But I finally got the virus. This is my first time getting sick in a very, very long time. I ended up missing Medball because of it as well.

## My Covid Diary

### Day 0

- Slight sore throat, small headache, only upon waking. Resolved very quickly.
- Plenty of energy during the rest of the day 

### Day 1 (PCR test)

- Sore throat and small headache upon waking. Tested negative on RAT in the morning
- Body aches, chills and slight nausea throughout the day. Lack of energy, unable to walk around for long periods. Sore throat was minor.
- Got PCR tested in the afternoon. Energy deteriorated after returning home.
- Hot showered to rid the chills. Slept for hours frorm 6pm. High fever, up to 39 degrees.
- Took paracetamol for the first time in 10 years.
- Had a slice of pizza for dinner. Generally disoriented, didn't brush teeth, wear contacts nor retainer. Went to bed, slept a long time.

### Day 2 (first full day of isolation)

- Seemingly a lot better. Had enough energy to watch a lecture.
- Sore throat deteriorated towards night time.
- Faint headache.
- Tested positive on RAT
- Still had chills upon showering.
- Ate breakfast and dinner normally. Slept early but otherwise normal awake hours. Had a meeting at night. Wore retainer.

### Day 3
- Woke up relatively early with heavy pain upon swallowing. Pain came and went throughout the day. Pain was helped by eating, warm water and honey water. Lozenges seemed to exacerbate pain. Couldn't speak throughout the day, had to whisper.
- Headache upon shaking head.
- No chills
- Low fever, possible aided by taking more paracetamol. Had lozenges for the first time in many years.
- Low energy throughout the day, slept or lied in bed through most of the day. Felt intermittently hot, even when not using blankets. More energy towards evening. Otherwise unproductive day.
- Really blocked nose, especially when lying down, causing inability to sleep.
- Lower appetite
- Quite intense pain at night. Didn't wear retainer.

### Day 4
- Woke up, again relatively early, perhaps because I went to bed early last night
- No longer feeling tired throughout the day
- Sore throat pain comes and go. Helped again by eating warm foods, and a couple of Strepsils. Still burning at times, but fine at other times. Also depends upon posture.
- No headache, perhaps helped by 2x paracetamol I took in the morning
- Ability to speak got better throughout the day
- Warm water helped ease the sore throat the most.
- Coughing more towards the afternoon. Could feel mucus upon urges to cough. Episodic releases of sticky, viscous, green phlegm, which cleared the throat and helped me regain speech.
- Mental strength regained, relatively alert. Didn't sleep during the day.
- More coughing with mucus and throat irritation. Not massive bursts but only when irritated, for example by stretching neck.
- Normal shower. No chills at all
- Regaining appetite
- Slight sneezing
- Well enough to wear contacts and retainers.
- Tested positive on RAT


### Day 5
- Woke up refreshed, albeit with slight headache and sore throat with mucus.
- Continued taking paracetamol
- Continual slight headache throughout the day
- Coughing intensely at night
- Still didn't do anything productive
- Slept at 2am and felt normal

### Day 6
- Continuing to cough with phlegm
- Slight sore throat
- Didn't take paracetamol
- Very slight headache
- Otherwise well
- Tested positive on RAT
- Sneezing

### Day 7
- Continuing sore throat, and coughing with phlegm
- Got better through the day, mentally alert

### Day 8 (first day out of isolation)
- Continuing sore throat, very light coughing with mucus, tiredness and fatigue

### Day 9
- Continuing sore throat, light coughing, tiredness
