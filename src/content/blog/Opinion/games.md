When I was young, I played a few board games. **Monopoly, chess, snakes and ladders**. I enjoyed playing weird **guessing and word games** as well.

During primary school, we played with our high bounce balls a lot. This included **two square, four square, eight square**, with the classic King, Queen, Jack, Dunce ordering. We also played **down ball** against a wall. We also played games in PE such as **rounders**, **continuous cricket**.

For 'educational' purposes, we also played **mathletics**, did **Reading Eggs** and **Skoodle**. Mathletics dressing up was the funnest thing. There used to be 5 stages including: Raging Rookie, ?, Speed Demon, Almost Einstein and Human Calculator, as well as 5 different levels of maths difficulty.

I won an iPad3 at the end of Year 4, my first electronic device (apart from TV, fridge, computers) conveniently just in time for BYOD beginning in Year 5. I would use that iPad until 1st year of uni. I had a couple of games on that iPad, including **Chinese Writer, Subway Surfers and Minecraft PE**. I bought the paid version of Minecraft PE towards the end of Year 5, and played on servers such as Lifeboat Skywars and Hunger Games in Year 6. I also played **Plants Vs Zombies 2** on my iPad outside of school.

During primary school on school computers, I also played **Fireboy and Watergirl** including its many variants and **Johnny Upgrade** on coolmathsgames. I also loved the Google Doodle game **Pacman anniversary game**. I continue to play this at the Chemist today. Occasionally I'd play the **Chrome Dinosaur Game** when there's no internet.

Outside of school, we also of course played **UNO**, **Jenga** and other classic physical games.

Outside of school, I would go to a friend's house sometimes and play **New Super Mario Bros Wii**, **Mario Kart Wii** and **Wii Sports**. I played **Super Smash Bros** around 5 times but it was really boring. 

During high school, we played games on unblocked websites on the computer in the morning before school, including **The Impossible Game, Vex 1, Vex 2 and Vex 3**. We also played **two square** and its variations during lunchtime. On my iPad I downloaded simple games such as **Geometry Dash and Stick Hero**.For a very brief period I'd play games I downloaded onto my laptop - **Asphalt 8** and that disturbing bike game **Happy Wheels**.

Occassionally I'd also play **Mahjong**, **contract bridge** and other card games such as **Cheat** and **Big Two**. But I've never really been into card games.

The game I played the most after Minecraft was probably **Clash Royale**, which I played from Year 9 until Year 10 when my iPad could no longer run it. **Tank trouble** also grew in popularity, as did **Head Soccer**. I played **The Sims Freeplay** for a couple of months in the middle secondary years.

After I got Facebook, I also played **Words with Friends 2** over Facebook messenger. During this period I also played **James Bond** at an annual New Year dinner at a friend's house.

During Year 11, I played **Just Dance** a few times and once in 2022, **Mario Kart Wii** once during Year 11, but I don't think I've played a console or computer game since before the pandemic. At the friend's house where I played Just Dance and Mario Kart Wii I also was introduced to and fell in love with **Codenames**.

However, as I've gotten older, I have enjoyed party games such as **Mafia**, **Werewolf**, **Codenames** a little more.

Finally, in 2022, I started playing **Wordle** and **Heardle** daily. I play **Waffle** occasionally. On a retreat in June I also played **Overcooked** on the Switch.

On placement in Bendigo, in 2022, I was introduced to a new range of board games: **Settlers of Catan** and **Secret Hitler**, war and social deception games which required a bit more thinking, cooperation and negotiation. Then there was **Photo Roulette**, a fun game to see how well you know your friends and which prompted much laughter. Finally, **Werewolf**, run on the phone, which is a simple, one night death form of Mafia, and **Spyfall**, a simple all-ages game which is also about social deception and group cohesive thinking, entertained.
