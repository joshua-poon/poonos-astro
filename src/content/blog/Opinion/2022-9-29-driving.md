I was wondering whether it'd be more cost effective for me to take PT or drive to uni. Here are some basic calculations on the matter.

#### Time
Driving takes 30-45 mins depending on traffic, including parking
PT: 65-90 mins, including walking

#### Cost
Driving: if the price is $2/L (it's usually higher because I use 98 fuel), this is $0.12 a km. The distance is 17km. Hence it costs approximately $2 for one way, and $4 for both ways. Parking is a maximum of $4.50 a day, so it costs $8.50. 
PT: $3.10 for daily concession fare.

Driving costs an extra $5 a day, which over one semester is an extra $240, and $480 over a year. But it is more convenient, comfortable, and saves time.
