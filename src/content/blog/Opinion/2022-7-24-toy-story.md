I rewatched Toy Story 4, the first and only film I've rewatched in 2022 - it was shown on free to air in July. I originally watched it in cinemas when it was released.

Honestly, I cried. Some people hate it for adding to the 'perfect' ending of Toy Story 3 in 2010, but for me, it gave the whole series greater depth, greater (although granted, terminal) direction and a sense of closure.

I won't go into an in depth review quite yet, but here were my notes from watching it.

Thoughts? Jokes? Symbolism. Nostalgism.
Feminisim. Motifs of moving on adn belong to a child vs lost toy. Of Woody's voice. Scary jump scare scenes. Redemption for Gabby. Romantic tension
