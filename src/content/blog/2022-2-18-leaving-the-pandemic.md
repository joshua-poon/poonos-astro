It's now been more than a month since the dramatic escalation of cases of the Omicron variant after Christmas. Here are my thoughts on QR codes, the booster shot and getting Covid.

Most people aren't checking in with QR codes, unless there are COVID marshalls. There have mostly only been COVID marshalls at places like the QV night market, libraries including the State Library of Victoria, Aus Open, the IMAX cinema, the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. Fair enough, given they are mostly events with presumably government-approved Covid-safe plans are the like. QR codes haven't served a purpose for a couple of months since the close contact isolation guidelines were changed to being in a household setting for around 4 hours, and since one in every few people have been diangosed for Covid.

Vaccination certificates are not really being checked when dining in, even though it's a requirement of hospitality. I feel that these would be scrapped sooner rather than later, now that such a large proportion of the state has been vaccinated. Many hospitality venues are already struggling with the 'shadow lockdown' as some commentators noted, self-imposed by Victorians, which was around for a few weeks in January. This was during the peak of Omicron cases, when many people were either isolating or choosing to shop or dine out less for fear of getting the virus.

I feel that people are beginning to get back into normal life. A month ago, I had a bunch of cancelled plans due to Covid isolation as well as precautions. Now, there is a general acceptance that it is inevitable everyone will get Covid. I've been asked the question 'Have you had Covid yet?' so many times in the past few weeks? There is a sort of sad tinge in the 'yet' - imagine if this had been asked 1.5 years ago during the second wave, or during the various lockdowns of 2021. I think that at some point we were proud that we had eliminated Covid - perhaps too perfectionistic. The media and politicians from both sides were flexing it and expressing their gratitude towards Victorians and health workers.

Speaking of which, major public hospitals in Melbourne were placed under a Code Brown last month to deal with the Omicron surge, to allow them to recall workers on leave. The health workers that I know have been busier than usual, for example dealing with Covid patients. It's clear from these anecdotes that Covid is not just like the flu - but part of this also comes from the week long isolation mandate that is not necessary for the flu. Many feel that Covid is becoming like the flu, where a yearly (optional, I might add, except for health workers) shot is provided.

At my workplaces, most people have either been tested positive, been required to isolate or have taken sick leave due to getting the booster shot, and as a result rostering has been all over the place over the past month. However, I now consistently work 4 shifts a week at my workplaces, so it has settled down a little. I've been asked this one question many times.

The booster shot has been mandated for both my workplaces, but the date has been extended. It's interesting that the conversations that are being had about the booster shot are quite different to the conversations around getting the first two doses. The vast majority of people I know have had the first two shots - the figure drops for the booster shot.

It is also worth noting that the third primary dose for immunocompromised patients is distinct from the booster shot for non-immunocompromised patients. I only realised that there was such a dose while working at my GP clinic

There is also hesitancy arising from the fact that booster shot interval from the 2nd shot has been slashed from it's original time of 6 months, to 5 months, to 4 months, and now to 3 months.

Among my friends and work colleagues, there is a sense of fatigue around the idea of a fourth shot being required, and of shots being required every few months. Many have had COVID already and have acquired some natural immunity. Most young people are not experiencing significant side effects from the Omicron variant. From others' anecdotes, it may be worse than the flu from a symptoms point of view, and you may be bedridden for a day or two. Most people I know (who are young) who are worried about getting Covid are worried for the sake of those around them who are more vulnerable.

Anyway, these were my two cents on the Covid pandemic over the past month, as well as the vaccines and government restrictions, mandates and rules. Hopefully by the time university begins we will have a clearer view of what lies ahead in terms of in-person classes, mandated booster shots (which some view as inevitable) and isolation periods.
