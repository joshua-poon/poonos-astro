I like the ABC. It's funny that the ABC is such a prominent topic in politics, just because it's government funded (hint that means we pay for it). Which makes it easy target for right-wingers to complain about left bias on the ABC. In parallel, the government constantly complains about it too. Or at least that's what the media tells us.

Maybe the ABC is just holding the government to account.

I love paying for the ABC. Maybe because I actually use their services quite a bit. I don't listen to ABC radio anymore, but still watch ABC news nightly. Commercial free, no sensationalist / useless news, and at my standard dinner time of 7pm. Their coverage of covid has been a bit excessive to be fair (they don't really need to dedicate that much live cuts to pollies' press conferences, they don't need to report daily cases in as much detail as they do, it's pretty much a pointless statistic now) but the rest of their reporting is still to decent quality. Of course, they have their obligatory charter requirements in relation to showcasing cultural diversity / community programs (at least state-based ABC) which I find punctuates recent news stories to give the bulletin a bit more variety. Plus you can't buy your way into a slot on the news, which gives it that bit of credibility.
