				ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Josh, a final year medical student from Australia.
			</h4>
			<p>
				I started this blog in 2021 as a means to build up my written
				expression, formulate opinions better and share my interests
				with others.
			</p>
			<p>
				I use the static site generator Astro to build my site, with
				main pages written in HTML/CSS and blog posts in Markdown. I use
				GitHub to store my code repository and Netlify to host my site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each post I write on falls under a category, which can be
				clicked on in the <a href="/blog">Blog</a>. Some topics I write
				on include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					As a full time medical student, my medical studies play a
					big part in my life. I enjoy writing about the rotations
					I've done and observations on placement.
				</li>

				<li>
					I love learning in my spare time, especially about history
					and linguistics. Furthermore, <a
						href="/blog/2021-11-05-tutoring"
						>here are details about my Latin tutoring services.</a
					>
				</li>

				<li>
					I write about life - whether it be memories growing up, or
					opinion pieces about pretty much anything from movie reviews
					to current affairs events - there are no limits within this
					category!
				</li>
			</ul>
